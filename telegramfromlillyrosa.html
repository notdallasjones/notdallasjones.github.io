If you walk through the streets, with the people all gathered with their heels making clicking noises against the cobblestone sidewalks as if it were some ancient language and their tops hats butting at each other like piglets fighting for food, then you can’t miss the signs.  The signs that proclaim, “HAVE YOU SEEN NICHOLAS LAVINSKY” At stages across the city they put on the show where the busty show girls hang around one handsome young man.  He takes their hands and slips into a rocket ship. He straightens his tuxedo. The crowd screams, “Don’t do it! Reconsider! Perhaps you have made a wrong choice and you should consider a career change. Perhaps you should take some time to go to the mountains and escape the city. It must be all of this smoke” they said “And the lights that don’t go off at night when it is supposed to be dark. This must be why you’re thinking like this!” And there’s always that one little girl in the back who screams, “Don’t leave the girl!  That is so rude of you, she will never take you back!”  But the gates close to the ship.  The handsome young man gives a courageous wave to the crowd assembled. And the rockets start. And you know this is what someone told the handsome man what to do. He never had an original idea his whole existence. </p>
<p>
The ship’s engines start. Yellow streamers explode underneath. Stage right, the theatre hand pulls the ship skyward.</p>

But the trick to the show, you see, is that the curtain never drop. Its a stage act. The curtain is down but it the veil is never lifted up.  The crowd can never clap and the show can never end.  The girls who were holding his hand can never leave the stage.  It all stays just like this until eventually the crowd leaves, tired of the show.  After not long at all they discover that they were never committed to waiting around until the curtain falls.  They never had to stay ‘til the end.  The final act that the crowd sees is the crowd leaving.  All but those on stage.  They crowd never sees what happens to them, for they are just a part of the show that everyone abandoned.  So all of these pretty girls are left on stage together, waiting for the curtain to fall. But of course there is no stage manager to tell them to leave.  The curtain never falls.  None of the girls even look at each other.  So they they repeat 6 shows a week until their skin starts to over over itself. They crowd had moved on and years later they read about it and assume its still all part of the show. And the crowd that never saw the end of the show assumes the curtain and the show must have ended. The final act of the show wasn’t just a girl waiting for a rocket ship to nowhere to come back.
