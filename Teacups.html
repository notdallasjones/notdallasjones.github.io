<p>Tea Cups</p>
<p>
Sometimes my mother and I switch places. For a day here and there she’ll forget her memories, carefully curated over 39 years. She’ll act a child, and look slanted downwards when I ask her what she wants. So I dress her in her favorite flower dress and make her breakfast and cereal as she struggles with her thoughts. She complains that this milk is too warm and that she doesn’t want to go to whoever she has to go that day. I give her a kiss on the top of her messy hair and prepare things about the house. She doesn’t thank me for the things I do when she forgets herself.</p>
<p>
When I’ve seen my mother out the door I stand on a stool and iron our clothes. I call my grandma on speaker phone. She talks about the nurses taking care of her who lift her up to wash her back and I complain about her daughter and the messes she makes on her white blouses. </p>
<p>
When we switch places I get to drink more sodas. I’m surprised that you can buy two liters of Sprite for less than a dollar and more so, that my mother never told me this. I drink it until I’m staring out my mother’s balcony window and I wonder about the pilgrims on the mayflower, floating out to sea leaving what they knew behind and sailing out into the inbetween. I wonder about Madeline, the french orphan from my bedtime stories, and why her parents won’t come to get her. But I know from what my mother tells me that this is the sugar talking.</p>
<p>
At nights, once I’ve put her to bed and cleaned up the dishes, I make myself a bowl of ice cream and watch Scooby Do until I fall asleep. </p>
<p>
The next day I sit at the kitchen table and she’ll rustle my shaggy hair and prepare the cereal, freshly showered, hair blow dried, and wearing her clicking heels. She’ll ask me if I’m excited about class today or the play about the Mayflower next week. Her voice goes up at the end up sentences to make sure she sounds approachable.</p>
<p>
I like how the world stacks, like a tea cup fitting under a tea pot. I like how the mask is always pulled off the villain at the end of the episode. I like when my mother pours orange juice as I sit at the table in the morning. </p>
<p>
After we’ve gone through the long motions of our days, she carries me to bed. She reads me Madeline under my Star Wars lamp and tucks the sheets in under my body. She makes a moment of it, making sure all the way down the sheets are creased beneath me, even down to my feet.</p>
<p>
And there she leaves me, tight in the grips of the sheets, under the incandescence of my glow-in-the-dark stars. </p>
