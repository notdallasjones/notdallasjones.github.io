 <p>Following Foxes</p>
<br></br>
<p>
I believe if you truly follow a fox long enough he will lead you to his burrow.  You liked this advice very much and read it in storybooks about foxes when you were younger.  Now you are older than before, as tends to happen, and you are a reporter.  You think about your boss and how much you wish to be like him.  You wish your boss were a fox just like the one in the stories.  You can see it: the two of you, playing petty games, causing your little mischief.   You are young and upcoming, and you hope to make an impression on that boss.  
</p>
<p>
So it is you that followed the foxes for so long.  Across still plains.  Through shaded track of pop-up storybook meadows.  At last you arrive.  Now you are the first person to be allowed into the fox’s den.
</p>
<p>
You believe yourself to be a good reporter so you scribble on your pad the things you see:
<p>Oranges</p> 
<p>Reds</p>
<p>Browns</p>
<p>Soft</p>
<p>Moist</p>
<p>
You note to yourself the slits for their eyes.  The slights of their hands.
Your notebook is put away.  The fox you have followed is before you and you are nervous, this being your first interview with a fox.  You rush your introduction, “hi,mynameis________andIwouldliketointerviewyouifyouwouldlike,oractuallyevenifyoudon’tlikebutthisismyfirstinterviewandIwouldreallyliketounderstandyou,toknowyou,thatsoundedabitoddbutitismyhopethatwemaymovebeyondit, may we begin?”</p>
<p>Foxes are delicate with their words.  They do not take too kindly to your botched opening.  They play along just the same.  <p>
<p>You don’t know it yet but they need you.  </p>
<p>You are invited to their dinner table and you take your seat among the rest.
Your notebook again you produce as you try to observe them.  Funny isn’t it—you observing the observing carnivore. </p>
<p>You watch and write:</p>
<p>Foxes at table</p>
<p>Mother serves food, yells at boys</p> 
<p>Plates, dishes, trays clink and clacker as passed above table</p>
<p>Shuffling beneath</p>
<p>Under table deals</p>
<p>Foxes trading with other foxes</p>
<p>What is it they swap?</p>
<p>Slits in eyes get smaller</p>
<p>Little conversation</p>
<p>Heads looks down</p>
<p>No more eye contact</p>
<p>Whispering</p>
<p>Snickering</p>
<p>With a single strike you scratch out all of these notes.</p>
<p>You replace them with another.  This time you hands move slow— </p>
<p>What goes on beneath the table?</p>
<p>The foxes tell their mother they must leave, “we’re leaving, we’re leaving.”  She doesn’t ask the questions why or to where they wish to roam.  She just dusts off those busy hands.  She knows where they are going.  But you don’t know yet.</p>
<p>To the neighbors, says the fox. They have to go see the neighbors.  </p>
<p>All foxes are friends, they tell you, and of course you follow because you want to see what the friend of a fox looks like. </p>
<p>Then you arrive at the neighboring den and they tell you to “Wait outside” and you say “Of course.” Then from their hidden pockets and satchels they produce sickles and shanks.  
You wait outside and scribble again your notes</p>

<p>Foxes with daggers</p>
<p>FDangerous</p>
<p>FDangerous foxes</p>
<p>Neighbors are not friends</p>
<p>Foxes are not friends </p>
<p>Never follow a fox!</p>
<p>Never follow a fox!</p>
<p>Clearly, you are afraid.</p>
<p>Then the foxes come out and wipe the last of the red from their blades.  They have been watching you through the slits in their eyes. </p>
<p>You tell them how they are not what you thought they were.  You recite to them all the old tales of the foxes that walked before them.  You even teach them one of their own petty games.
Why would all the folktales before tell to follow a fox if foxes are dangerous? 
Then they tell you their story.  They’ve let many before you follow them deep into their dens.  They have ways, they say, to make sure reporters write good stories of foxes.  All stories of foxes end the same.  For if one truly wants to know the truth about foxes all they must do is follow a fox for long enough. </p>
<p>
Then they tell you to write a new fox story, same as the old.  This story will have more petty games.  This one will have more innocence.  Use your imagination, the foxes tell you, make believe a petty game you believe a fox would play.  This is how foxes have lived for some time now.  In this way, stories of that child-like fox will continue to be told from child to child. </p>
<p>
So you become famous because you have written a series of well-known fox stories just for kids.  They applaud you for your imagination.  If only they knew.  And you wish you could tell them, but foxes have ways of keeping you silent. </p>
<p> At the end of each white page your write in a deep white ink: Never follow a fox.</p>
