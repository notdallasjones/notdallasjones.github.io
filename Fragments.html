We find things mildly interesting more interesting than the interesting ones. We refer to cinema as 'neorealist' and everything elsea as 'realist.' Its our greatest fear.</p>

"I did it" he said rolling over.<br>
"Did what?"<br>
"I got another dream cycle in."<br>
"Are you still in it?"<br>
"No. But I wanted to and I did. Now it's over and I'm up"</p>

I am in this place now, this week, where I just feel really really happy. I have this profound sense of relief filling my body and spilling out of my ears. I am getting back into the things I like to do and reconnecting with what I want and taking notice of the wonderful things that I am cultivating for myself in life. That feels good. I have been reading poems about grief before I go to bed instead of smoking pot and enjoying my morning coffee in a religious way. I had a dream last night where I was with a bunch of people and will was there with a new girlfriend. I didn’t care too much in the dream, it didn’t touch me too deeply. Also he was wearing this gross headband thing that he used to wear a lot when I first met him and eventually asked him never to wear again because it made me never want to have sex with him. I didn’t say it that strongly at the time but that is how I felt. I think that is a good sign, he isn’t fully what I want.- email from lillian </p>

Imagine: lost out in space alone at floating in void. And all you can do is type to one cosmonaut who can't speak or spell any English and you don’t know how to type or speak any Russian. You only see him typing not even his face. Just the messages. Imagine: it’s actually AI trained to carry casual conversations by the Russian scientists so they didn't have to do their job.</p>

The leader of the opposition party once, years after the war during a dinner gala described how he met his misses:
<br>
Her late-husband died of measles. The opposition’s force seized but they did a peculiar tactic. They worked not attack the lady’s body of land but surround them. Settling in on all sides, minor skirmishes here and there to keep them contained. Their forces surrounded the general came forward and the wife, seeing her total defeat and the generals domination of her dominion succumbed to him and fell in love. The party repeated this story and for years they proclaimed this as the greatest story of the wars great outcome and for many years the men referred to this as "love"</p>

"If you didn't mean it then why did you say 'I love you I love you'<br>
"Because it was raining and I was leaving and a bit drunk" </p>
